## [Add pushbuttons to prototype](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/25)

- Added three button to do three different functionalities
    - Tare feature to zero the scale after putting weight when button is pressed
    - Timer function that starts to count and show on the OLED display when the button is pressed
    - Wake up
- Added an active buzzer for sound effects    

## [Configure Deep Sleep mode](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/23)

- Added a deep sleep mode by following this [website](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-deep-sleep-arduino-ide-wake-up-sources/)
- Currently, the threshold weight for deep sleep is <1g 

## [Create flow rate display algorithm](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/20)

- Although this works, we still need to figure out a better method of testing

## [Run tests on breadboard prototype](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/26)

- Tested the core functionalities of our prototype for our midterm presentation
    - More details can be found in our [testing document](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/blob/main/documentation/TestDocument.md)
- Scale
    - Accuracy Test
        - Benchmarked three different objects to determine the scale's accuracy
    - Precision Test
        - Weighed the same object multiple times to determine consistency
- Timer
    - Ran a known timer at the same time to determine accuracy
- Deep sleep timer
    - Tested deep sleep timer by letting an object rest for more than 30 seconds, removing it, and then waiting
