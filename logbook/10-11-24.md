# Libraries for the E-Ink display
- Installed "adafruit_EPD", "adafruit GFX", and "adafruit ImageReader" library from arduino
- From https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_EPD, I downloaded and moved the src folder to the arduino library folder

*** So far the example code i copied has finally compiled. Next goal is to try and change image in the display. However, will need to verify the pin connections again.
