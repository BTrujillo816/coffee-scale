## [Interface with eInk display using ESP32-S3 IRL](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/11)

- Installed "adafruit_EPD", "adafruit GFX", and "adafruit ImageReader" library from arduino
- From https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_EPD, I downloaded and moved the src folder to the arduino library folder

So far the example code I copied has finally compiled. Next goal is to try and change image in the display. However, will need to verify the pin connections again.
