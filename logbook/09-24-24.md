## Load Cell Wiring Guide to HX711
    - E+ (red wire) stands for Excitation Positive of the load cell
        - Connects to the Analog Voltage Supply Pin (AVDD or VIN) of the HX711
    - E- (black ire) stands for Excitation Negative of the load cell
        - Connects to the Analog Ground (AGND or GND) of the HX711
    - A+ (white wire) stands for Signal Positive of the load cell
        - Connects to the Positive Input for channel A (INA+ or A+) of the XH711
    - A- (green wire) stands for Signal Negative of the load cell
        - Connect to the Negative Input for channel A (INA- or A-) of the HX711

    ***Important: Since no datasheet came with the acquired load cell. Assume manufacturer followed this convention.
        1. Red Wire (E+): Positive excitation
        2. Black Wire (E-): Negative excitation
        3. White Wire (A+): Positive signal output
        4. Green Wire (A-): Negative signal output
