## [Start Project Schematic](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/10)

### Details

- Status: Version 001
- Hardware
  - ESP32-S3
  - HX711
  - Custom UC8151D
  - Custom Strain Gauge
  - MCP72831

### Wiring Guide

#### Load Cell Wiring Guide to HX711
    - E+ (red wire) stands for Excitation Positive of the load cell
        - Connects to the Analog Voltage Supply Pin (AVDD/VIN) of the HX711
    - E- (black ire) stands for Excitation Negative of the load cell
        - Connects to the Analog Ground (AGND/GND) of the HX711
    - A+ (white wire) stands for Signal Positive of the load cell
        - Connects to the Positive Input for channel A (INA+ or A+) of the XH711
    - A- (green wire) stands for Signal Negative of the load cell
        - Connect to the Negative Input for channel A (INA- or A-) of the HX711
    
    *** Important: Since no datasheet came with the acquired load cell. Assume manufacturer followed this convention.
        1. Red Wire (E+): Positive excitation
        2. Black Wire (E-): Negative excitation
        3. White Wire (A+): Positive signal output
        4. Green Wire (A-): Negative signal output

#### HX711 to ESP32-S3
    - HX711 SCK (Serial Clock) or PD_SCK 
        - Connect to any GPIO
    - HX711 DATA (Data Output) or DOUT
        - Connect to any GPIO
    - HX711 E+ (Excitation Positive)
        - Connect to AVDD/VIN
    - HX711 E- (Excitation Negative)
        - Connect to GND

#### ESP32 to E-ink Display
    - Power Connections:
        - VIN → Connect to 5V (or 3.3V, depending on your display’s requirement)
        - 3.3V → Connect to VDD3P3 on the ESP32-S3
        - GND → Connect to GND on the ESP32-S3
    
    - SPI Connections:
        - SCK → Connect to SCK of ESP32-S3 (GPIO36 on the ESP32-S3 Feather)
        - MISO → Connect to MISO of ESP32-S3 (GPIO37 on the ESP32-S3 Feather)
        - MOSI → Connect to MOSI of ESP32-S3 (GPIO35 on the ESP32-S3 Feather)
        - ECS (Chip Select) → Connect to any GPIO 
        - D/C (Data/Command) → Connect to any GPIO
        - SRCS (Source Select) → Connect to any GPIO 
        - SDCS (Data Chip Select) → Connect to any GPIO 
        - RST (Reset) → Connect to any GPIO
        - BUSY → Connect to any GPIO
        - ENA (Enable) → Connect to any GPIO
    
    *** Necessary Pins for E-ink Display
        - SCK: Required for clocking the data into the E-ink display.
        - MISO: Typically used for data feedback from the E-ink display to the ESP32-S3. Not always necessary unless display requires it for certain operations (like reading status).
        - MOSI: Essential for sending data from the ESP32-S3 to the E-ink display.
        - ECS: This is important to tell the E-ink display when to listen to the data being sent. Without this, the display may not respond correctly.
        - D/C : Important for distinguishing between data and command instructions sent to the display. It helps the display interpret what type of data it is receiving.
        - RST: Often required to initialize the display. Without this, may not be able to reset the display or clear it properly.
    
    *** Optional Pinks for E-ink Display 
        - BUSY: Indicates when the display is busy processing data. It's useful for synchronizing operations but may not be strictly necessary for all applications.
        - SRCS: Might be used to select between different sources for data or power. Depending on your display.
        - SDCS: Similar to ECS, this pin is likely used to select the data source. If display has both ECS and SDCS, check the documentation to see if both are necessary, as sometimes they can serve similar purposes.
        - ENA: Typically enables or disables the display. It may be required to power on the display or enable certain functions. It's a common pin in various display modules.

### Notes

- ESP32-S3 has a lot more features than your standard ESP32. I am wondering if we should build this with an ESP32 instead of mounting on a ESP32-S3.

### Details

- Status: Incomplete
- Hardware:
  - Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather
  - R: 220 $\ohm$ 
  - LED (Red)

### Soldering Headers

- In order to breadboard with these components, we had to solder headers onto the ESP32-S3, EYESPI Breakout Board, and HX711 breakout board
  - HX711
    - Might need to reflow some solder joints

### Notes

``````
A fatal error occurred: Could not open COM6, the port doesn't exist
Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 2
``````

In order to solve this error, I have attempted the following:

- Uninstalled and reinstalled Arduino IDE
- Downloaded and installed CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers from [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
- Restarted my computer multiple times
- Swapped USB-C cable
