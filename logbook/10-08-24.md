## [Create a Nice Readable Schematic](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/16)

### Rules/Conventions

- Signals should flow from left to right

- PWR on top, GND always down
  - ![image-20241016150546081](C:\Repositories\coffee-scale\logbook\10-08-24.assets\image-20241016150546081.png)
- Lines should never be on an angle
  - Up, down, left, right
- Never, **ever** have lines going through your chip symbols
- Annotations should be horizontal
  - The person shouldn't have to tilt their head to read them

- Designators and their values can either be together on one side, or on opposite sides of a symbol

  - Just make sure you are consistent

- Set pins to snap grid when creating symbols

- No need to show footprints on schematic

- Net name should be on top of netlist/lines

- Don't assign nets to things that have ports (+3V3 net when you have a 3V3 port)

- Avoid crossing wires if possible

  - Edit symbol to move pins even if it doesn't match the physical layout

- Don't label nets if you are not going to use them

- Signify if a symbol is going out to prevent confusion (someone might think it's a completed circuit)

- Don't run wires through the schematic if you don't have to

- Connectors don't have to be next to the components; however, you must properly label the nets

- Net names should be meaningful and nonredundant

- Either change the symbol to all match the physical in mapping or group them up by functionality so that they support signal flow
  - If you edit for symbol flow, make sure that the inputs are on the left and outputs are on the right
- Be consistent with schematic symbols i.e. for capacitors, resistors
- Do not use decimal points for values in your schematic
  - 0.01uF > 100nF or 100n
- Use ports for outputs
- Label sections with notes
- Make LEDS and other symbols vertical
- Don't create four way junctions off a single node
- Designators can be renamed if you truly need to but keep it short and sweet
- Use A4 schematic size since we're yankees
