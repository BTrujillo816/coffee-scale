## Update on OLED display and Load Cell
- Load Cell: Successfully calibrated and now measures weight with acceptable tolerance
- OLED Display: Functions as intended when tested with example code
- Integration: Preliminary code to connect the load cell and OLED display
    - Code found [here](../software/ino/OLED_LoadCell_Code/Oled_LoadCell_Code.ino)
    - Result found [here](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Result_Oled_LoadCell_Test.jpg) 

## Notes
- Power/wiring issues
    - OLED display or HX711 sometimes does not get power
    - This was evident when rewring peripherals around
    - As of right now [this](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Wiring.jpg) setup works
- Our known weight is 60.3 gram [plier](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Test_Weight.jpg)
    - The result is acceptable as can be seen from this [image](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Result_LoadCell_Test.png)
