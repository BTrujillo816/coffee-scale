## Interface with eInk Display using ESP32 on Wokwi

### Details

- Status: Incomplete
- Hardware
  - ESP32-S3
  - ePaper 2.9"
- Software
  - Wokwi
  - C++

### Notes

- I cannot find an example Wokwi project using the [Adafruit EDP Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_EPD) that works properly

  - The error seems to be with the GXEPD2 library

    - ```
      Error installing GxEPD2: Library install failed: testing local archive integrity: testing archive size: fetched archive size differs from size specified in index: 176128 != 4501132
      ```

- I'll need to learn how to upload custom libraries
  - It might be easier if I set up Wokwi for VS Code



## Start Project Schematic

### Details 

- Status: Incomplete
- Software
  - KiCAD

### Notes

- We needed to make a custom symbol within KiCAD
  - This can be found within
- I cannot figure out what electrical type MISO and MOSI should be
  - [Related Forum Post](https://forum.kicad.info/t/electrical-type-for-spi-device-miso-pins/9444)
- I think Adafruit really wants us to use a breakout board to interface with the eInk display
  - Without it, we'd have to solder headers onto the display if we wanted to use it on a breadboard

### Misc

```
// 2.9" Tricolor Featherwing or Breakout with UC8151D chipset
// ThinkInk_290_Tricolor_Z13 display(EPD_DC, EPD_RESET, EPD_CS, SRAM_CS,
// EPD_BUSY, EPD_SPI);
```

- I found this on the [Adafruit EDP Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_EPD). This might give insight on to what data pins actually matter.
