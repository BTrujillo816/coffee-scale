## Blink an LED with ESP32

### Components

- ESP32-S3
- $220 \ohm$ resistor
- LED

### Notes

- [Wokwi Project](https://wokwi.com/projects/409566066184866817)

- I used this [tutorial](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/esp32/led-blink.html) to blink a singular LED on Wokwi

## Use ESP32 to interface with HX711 and Load Cell in Wokwi

## Components

- ESP32-S3
- HX711
- Load Cell

- I used the Example Arduino Sketch from the [Hobby Components forum post](https://forum.hobbycomponents.com/viewtopic.php?f=73&t=1763) by Andrew Davies
  - I prefer this to using the HX711 Arduino library as I eventually want to learn how to implement this in ESP-IDF using C.
    - The HX711 datasheet contains a reference driver in both ASM and C
