## [Update schematic to include OLED display](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/18)

### General

- Added [datasheet](../coffee-scale\documentation\assets\SSD1306.pdf) to documentation branch

### Eagle File to KiCAD

- Why does Adafruit only offer Eagle files :c

### Symbol Creation

- Figured out that we don't need it anyways
  - Added 08x02 connectors to socket display



## [Make a Nice Readable Schematic](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/16)

### LiPo Battery Charger

- Replaced SparkFun ESP32 Thing circuit with prettier circuit from Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather 

### Power and Filtering

- Changed custom JST connector to boring KiCAD 01x02 connector
  - I should place this on the left side to have it function clearly as an input

### Load Cell

- Edited symbol so no wires crisscross

### ADC

- Added No Connect flags

### Microcontroller

- Added No Connect flags

### Display

- Made wiring nice and pretty
- Added text
  - I should add more text about the actual display
