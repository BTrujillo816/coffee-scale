## [Interface with OLED display IRL](https://github.com/BTrujillo816/coffee-scale/issues/17)

### Components

- [SPI OLED Display 128x32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/661)
- Arduino Uno

I followed this [Adafruit Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/wiring-128x32-spi-oled-display) to test the SPI OLED on an Arduino Uno.

This code can be found in [here](../software/ino/ssd1306_128x32_spi/ssd1306_128x32_spi.ino)

### Adafruit ESP32 Feather

- Load Cell: Successfully calibrated and now measures weight with acceptable tolerance
- OLED Display: Functions as intended when tested with example code
- Integration: Preliminary code to connect the load cell and OLED display
  - Code found [here](../software/ino/OLED_LoadCell_Code/Oled_LoadCell_Code.ino)
  - Result found [here](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Result_Oled_LoadCell_Test.jpg) 

- Power/Wiring issues
  - OLED display or HX711 does not receive power at certain points along the power rail
    - This was evident when rewiring peripherals
    - As of right now, [this](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Wiring.jpg) setup works
- Our known weight is a 60.3 grams [plier](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Test_Weight.jpg)
  - The result is acceptable, as can be seen from this [image](../logbook/10-30-24.assets/Result_LoadCell_Test.png)
