## PCB Design
### Footprint
- Mostly chose the 1206 because apparently is SMD soldering friendly
- Some footprints like the USB and JSTPH im unsure of

### Routing
- Initially tried to do bottom copper as ground plane but having a hard time connecting signal traces in a two layer pcb
- resorted to going back to orthogonal method.
- Ended up mixing both.
    - Not the best routing/tracing job. 
    - Removed all the error in DRC.
        - Hopefully it works
