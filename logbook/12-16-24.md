## PCB Edits
    - Changed ESP32 footprint
    - Changed USB footprint
    - Finished routing all traces
    - DRC found no errors except some warnings

## DRC Errors
    - Copper zone being cut off because of running traces on the bottom layer
        - Causing ground connection issues(annoying issue to tackle)
            - Made bottom layer traces as close to each other and only as needed
            - Made sure theres no island copper fill
    - Ignored USB and PCB clearance errors
    - Minor errors all around like having a silkscreen minumum height of .8 mm were fixed
